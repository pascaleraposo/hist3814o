Got access to Slack during week, easy to access (accessible everywhere, including work)
Not home for weekend; did not realise first "assignment" to be so extensive
No laptop owned, only iMac at home...
Therefore unable to download VPN
Will use/set up DHBox when home
Created github (obviously)
    http://github.com/pascaleraposo
Created account for Hypothesis
    user:pascaleraposo
Created domain on Remain Hosting

    Still configuring some things on it, such as visual appeal and pages.
Downloaded Hypothesis Google Chrome extension, will redownload at home.
Looked at the readings -- Interesting!
Finished readings... Annotated where I had comments.
I don't feel too out of place in this class... I got a better underderstanding that originally thought of 
Working on the blog entry to be posted by Sunday, midnight.
